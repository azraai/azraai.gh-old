          <p>Salam. Hello.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes. Maybe there are some thoughts still lingering in our mind. I hope you read this till the end even if you’re annoyed. (I know you are annoyed).</p>

<p>Hi again. How is life? (Lama dah tak tanya soalan ni). Busy, tired, hectic might be your answer, as always. Assignment, test, quiz. Itu belum outside class. PGCE lah, NRIC lah. The only woman that have the same energy is my mum, of course.</p>

<p>“I’m not your girlfriend and you’re not my boyfriend”. That was some pretty harsh words. (Perasan pun ada). Truth is after Afiq’s significant other passed away on your birthday last year. Some of my worldview changed, I no longer care about uncertainty in life. Seeing someone close felt into deep sorrow, is a life changing. For a couple of weeks, the class we felt into silent and reassess our priority. I choose to make the best of why I have at any point of my life. Travel (Bandung, Bangkok are done. Possibly Istanbul in late June if god will) gain experience, make new friends, and make people around me happy.</p>

<p>If you feel this an attempt to catch you attention again, forget it. Someone who I treat as sister, once told me, when the time has come, both will find each other at the right place and the right moment. Until then, just keep the naughty feeling away.</p>

<p>After the “intrusion” into your roommate privacy, I am not sure what really made you mad. Till this day, I’m still waiting for an answer. I’m not sure whether to move forward, forget about it, and pretend nothing happened. By the way you act now, it seems you’re running away from me. To start again with a blank slate is something impossible. I know you will not forget about it. I believe the only way for us to solve this problem is having a face to face conversation. If you’re in KL near future, we maybe can have some drinks together, again. (Been in Penang twice is last two months but then &#8230;). Throughout my life, there are only few people that are close to me. Those who are I am comfortable to tell some of the darkest secret and not for public tales. Fikri, Airil, Afiq and there is you.</p>

<p>If you still remember, there was a night we choose not to sleep, bet who will to fell asleep first. Just treat this writing as the memory of that night.</p>

<p>If you choose to keep yourself away or running for me over the good old days, I have no other words to express. Keep telling me and yourself, you&#8217;re not going to be the same person anymore is an escapism. It won&#8217;t bring any greater good. It kill both of us. It eats up our emotion and state of mind. If you feel you’re not comfortable or awkward to talk to me again, just tell me what to do. I will greatly able to help.</p>

<p>I might send over a literature work that were recently owned but have been read few times before. Much more stronger than your “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus”. Let see if I have some time to go the post office.</p>

<p>Shakespeare wrote, the world is the stage. It up to ourselves either to express flattery or bring good the ourself and the audience.</p>

<p>Night, night, sleepyhead. :P. I have flight to catch in the dawn.</p>

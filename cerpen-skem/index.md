<strong>Hiatus</strong>

This work was written and emerge from my mind between July 2013 until today. There are some written works that has not been published. This sorry somehow related with my worldview and life. There are characters which are closed to my life. In other words, there are important. Last September, one of us lost his significant others and my changed my world view.

That event justify what I'm going to do next. There are timeline and storyline changes. Possibly there are some of my travel experiences will be in the next iteration. The story will uphold the zeitgeist of my time.

Tragedy changed ourself but how we rise up from the tragedy defined us.
